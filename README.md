# NineGaps-the-Game
Nine Gaps the Game in C.
NineGaps is a highly addictive and tricky puzzle game.

The goal of the game is really simple. You have to use your wits to place numbers from 1 to 9 in the missing gaps, while matching the operations presented in the puzzle. It's just like sudoku, but different!

My aim is to complete the game in all the languages as I learn them all
